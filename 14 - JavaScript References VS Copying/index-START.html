    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 10;
    let age2 = age;
    //age,age2 10
    age2 = 15;
    //age 10, age2 15

    // Let's say we have an array
    //array change is by ref
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    let team = players;
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    //team,players both change cuz team is only a ref to players
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //use slice to make a copy1
    const copyPlayers = players.slice();
    copyPlayers[2] = 'Newperson';
    const copy2 = [].concat(players);
    //Now original players array is untouched
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const copy4 = Array.from(players);
    //obj also have like array as ref
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const obcopy1 = Object.assign({},person,{phone = 99886}); //empty obj, original obj,new props
    //Object.assign does only one level deep
    //newobj.subobj.property will be reflected in both if done in one
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //cheat way for deep copy
    const objCopy2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); //convert to string and parse it back to obj
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
